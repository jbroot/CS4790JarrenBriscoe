- Are the appointment reasons hard coded? if so what are the additional appointment types? Should we include an 'other' field? Or should 
  we just leave the comments field?
- Any preference for UI design/Admin portal (colors)? Likes/Dislikes from simplybookme
- An advisor can manually cancel appointments, can they manually create them (like for follow up during an appointment)?
- What things would you like to see in the general settings? General report?
- How is your availability set up? What improvements would you like to see?
